      "Calculus Lecture Notes Professor John Doe January 30, 2025 1 Limits and Continuity Definition 1 (Limit). Let f be a function defined on some open interval containing a (except possibly at a). We say the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written: lim x\u2192a f(x) = L if for every \u03f5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that whenever 0 < |x \u2212a| < \u03b4, then |f(x) \u2212L| < \u03f5. Example 1. Find the limit: lim x\u21922 x2 \u22124 x \u22122 Solution: lim x\u21922 x2 \u22124 x \u22122 = lim x\u21922 (x \u22122)(x + 2) x \u22122 = lim x\u21922(x + 2) = 4 2 Derivatives Definition 2 (Derivative). The derivative of a function f at x is: f \u2032(x) = lim h\u21920 f(x + h) \u2212f(x) h provided this limit exists. Theorem 1 (Power Rule). For any real number n, d dxxn = nxn\u22121 Example 2. Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x4 + 2x2 \u22125 Solution: f \u2032(x) = 12x3 + 4x 1 3 Integrals Definition 3 (Definite Integral). The definite integral of f from a to b is: Z b a f(x)dx = lim n\u2192\u221e n X i=1 f(x\u2217 i )\u2206x Theorem 2 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). If f is continuous on [a, b] and F is an",
